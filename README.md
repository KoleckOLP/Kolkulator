This repo had a problem and I chose to split Kolkulator into languages:

QBasic: https://github.com/KoleckOLP/KolkulatorQB <br>
C# .Net Core: https://github.com/KoleckOLP/KolkulatorCS <br>
Python 3: https://github.com/KoleckOLP/Kolkulator3PY <br>


# Kolkulator3PY
multiplatform CLI calculator written in <s>.NET Core 2.2</s> Python3

to run my builds you need:<br>
<s>win10-x64, osx.10.14-x64, ubuntu 18.04-x64<br></s> Anything that runs python and dependecies, Win, Lin, Mac, BSD, HaikuOS, Android
